# LanternFall
A website aimed to raise awareness of the invasive species of lanternflies.
Users can sign up to view a map of their area. On the map, the user can see pins from other users.
These pins are posts from other users that signal the kill of a lanternfly. The user can post their kills with an image and text. That post will then show up on the map
